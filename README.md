# Edge_Vision
## Introduction
We are actively conducting research focused on the design and optimization of lightweight AI models capable of running efficiently on edge devices. Our primary goal is to develop high-performance AI solutions for real-time perception in autonomous driving scenarios. Key research activities include leveraging edge devices such as the Jetson AGX Orin to implement and optimize these models. By utilizing state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Pruning, and Quantization, we aim to minimize memory usage and inference time while maintaining stable performance.
Additionally, our research explores hardware acceleration and parallel processing tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks, providing optimal solutions tailored for autonomous driving systems.
